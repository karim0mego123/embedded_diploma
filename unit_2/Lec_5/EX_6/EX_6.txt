size of union = largest size of its members
char a[32] ; size is 32 byte 
float x ;    size is 4  byte 
int   y ;    size is 4  byte
so size of union = 32 
size of struct = sum of size of its members 
char a[32] ; size is 32 byte 
float x ;    size is 4  byte 
int   y ;    size is 4  byte

so size of struct = 32 + 4 + 4 = 40
